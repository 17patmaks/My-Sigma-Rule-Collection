CVE-2025-49666 is an overflow vulnerability in iperf3 that can be triggered during a connection shutdown sequence, allowing a malformed or unexpected input to cause the service to crash. In the scope of detection engineering, this flaw is notable because exploitation attempts often produce abnormal process terminations, unexpected network session closures, or anomalous error output that can be captured in logs. Effective detections focus on identifying recurring crashes of iperf3, unusual shutdown request patterns, or attacker-controlled network traffic designed to force the application into the overflow condition.
