# Collection of Sigma Rules That I Created From things I found interesting

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of custom Sigma rules I've created based on vulnerabilities, threat reports, and techniques I found interesting. Each rule includes references, detection logic, and context on why it matters. I’ll continue expanding this collection as I research new threats and improve my detection engineering skills.
